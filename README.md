# :wave: Introducing template-starter-server

A minimal and flexible template to quickly deploy a simple server using Docker Compose. This template includes essential components to set up and manage a lightweight server for various machines, such as Raspberry Pi, personal computers, or other servers in your network

**🎊 Use this template as a starting point for creating personalized server configurations across your network with ease 🎊**

Features:

- `Nginx` as a reverse proxy for handling incoming requests.
- [gethomepage/homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage) for a customizable landing page.
- Docker discovery service to easily find and manage Docker containers across machines.
- Devcontainer setup for seamless development and containerized environment.

> [!NOTE]
> We appreciate the great effort they put into [gethomepage/homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage). Don't forget to visit their repository to learn how to configure your homepage and leave your ⭐ in the process.

# :fire: How to mount your starter-server

The `starter-server` is prepared to run in a docker environment using a docker compose file.

Before runs, you need create an network for the discovery service in homepage and the routing with nginx can works both resolving dns through docker dns manager. The template waiting connecting with a docker network called `server`.

```bash
docker network create server
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you want change this network name, remember apply the same changes along all docker-compose.yaml file, for each service defined.

Now you can run `starter-server` simply executing the compose project

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then, visit the site `http://localhost/` with your friendly browser.

## Containers

The project up trhee containers:

- `reverse_proxy`: An reverse proxy implemented with `nginx`. Use the minimal configuration in `./nginx/nginx.conf`. Is prepared to resolve aditional configurations in the folder `./nginx/conf.d`.
- `homepage`: Is an instance of [gethomepage/homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage). Mount the config from `./hompage/config` and some images stored in `./homepage/images`. The current settings show some populars sites and a plex services expected found running as a container docker in the same docker network.
- `dockerproxy`: Is a docker proxy to enable [Discovery Service for homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/configs/docker/#automatic-service-discovery).

## Hostname

This template is prepared to use a hostname `server.local`. For local environments you could need setup the hostname in your host.

For Linux is enough edit the file `/etc/hotst` and add something like this:

```bash
127.0.0.1 server.local
127.0.0.1 plex.server.local # Adds this if you want probe the subdomine routing option
```

For windows is similar, but the file is usually found in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

If you want change the string `server.local` for other like `myawesomeserver.local` you will need replace all reference into `docker-compose.yaml`, `nginx.conf`, `plex.conf`, `./homepage/config/*`, and `/etc/hosts` files.

## Plex subdomine

The template adds an example to mount a Plex service integration like a subdomine. For that you need:

- Prepare the hostname in your host
- Sure that the plex container is deploy into the same external docker network
- Rename the file `./nginx/conf.d/plex.conf.example` for `./nginx/conf.d/plex.conf`
- Replace the dns name in `./nginx/conf.d/plex.conf` location and `./homepage/config/services.yaml` with the container name of plex

if all configurations is ok, you can visit `http://plex.server.local` directly in your browser or from your `starter-server` root `http://server.local`
